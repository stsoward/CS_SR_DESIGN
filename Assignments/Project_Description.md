Mobile App managed RC Powered Wheel for Boards
## Abstract
The goal of eeZPower is to create a device that can be quickly attached to any type of board (skateboard, longboard,etc) that provides the convenience of a motorized one while being just as quick to remove. It does not take long going up a small incline to realize how inconvenient and energy intensive it is. Current solutions are either expensive or require tools to attach. Our device aims to solve those issues while allowing your boardâ€™s original hardware to stay intact.
## Existing Solutions
Power boards exist, but they are often quite expensive. Additionally, you would not take a power board to the skate park, which is half the reason a lot of people skate. Another option would be having to swap the front trucks of my board with a powered alternative such as the [Revel Kit.](https://www.revelboards.com/products/revel-kit-electric-skateboard) Not only is this out of my price range but that would require tools and time to go back to have to regular skateboard again. No one wants to attempt tricks while risking damage to expensive technology.
## My Background
I have some experience with coding in Arduino to program microcontrollers which I plan to use as the control module for this device. Furthermore, my experience in SQL, C#, Python, and operating systems that I have gained through co-op and class curriculum will be applicable.
## Project Proposed Solution
The approach is to design a powered wheel attachment that goes under your board and straps to it. The idea is to allow the conversion of any skateboard or longboard, into a powered board, and back again in a matter of seconds. It will make use of a control board (some sort of microcontroller), a radio controller, and a mobile app. Further description is available within the [Design Diagrams](/Assignments/Design_Diagrams) and associated description file. By the end of this Sr Design project, I expect to have at least a working prototype of a marketable product.
