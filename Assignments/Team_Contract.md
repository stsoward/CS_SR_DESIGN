# Team Meetings
Since this is a one-person team, meetings will not be held on a certain day of the week.  <br>
However, every week on Friday, work that has been done during the prior week will be listed to document progress. <br>
This will be maintained on the [Project Status](/Assignments/Project_Status.md#project-status) document. <br>
The total hours dedicated to the project will be kept track of on the [Appendix](/Assignments/Appendix.md#hour-log) document.
# Project Focus
Focus will be put on having a complete demonstratable product by the expo on 4/12/22. Certain aspects of the project may be limited in interest of this focus. This aspect is more thoroughly described in the [Major Constraints](/Assignments/Major_Project_Constraints.md#time) Document.
