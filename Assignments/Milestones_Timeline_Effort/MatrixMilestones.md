Milestone | Expected Completion Date | Description
----- | ----- | -----
Complete Preliminary Research | Oct. 30th | Completion of these tasks will identify the physical components to be worked with.
Begin Application Development and Microcontroller Development | Nov 15th | The development of the phone app and microcontroller code will need to be done simultaneously since the design of one will affect the design of the other.
Obtain all components | Nov 30th | All components should be obtained to allow the piecing together of the physical product.
Finish development on motor and battery controls | Jan 15th | Completing this development allows for focus on physical design and communication between application and microcontroller.
Complete application development | Feb 15th | Having the application in place will allow for the testing of communication between app and microcontroller.
Complete Physical Design | March 15th | Once all components are complete, they can all be put together into the final product for extensive testing
Begin final testing and presentation preparation | April 1st | At this point final bugs should be worked out and presentation should be worked on until expo on 4/12/22
