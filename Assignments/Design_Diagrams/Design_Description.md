## This document is designed to give more context and describe each component within the design diagrams

# Components
The project has three major components <br>
- The Mobile App
  - This is used to manage the power mode of the device and display any graphical interface pertaining to the device and its use (such as battery level, trip statistics, etc.)
- The Device
