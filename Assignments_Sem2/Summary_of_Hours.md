For the fall semester, most of the time spent was dedicated to researching the feasibility of this being a one-person project as well as identifying components and software to use. Assignments also took a large chunk of time. Research includes part research, research into existing solutions, into open-source software related to the project and preliminary research into Android app development in Java.

Spring semester was more hands on after I was able to order all of the parts I identified in the previous semester. I was successful in getting all the parts for a proof-of-concept prototype in working order. For this I have broken time into different sections. Code dev combines all learned usage of the vesc-uart library that the ESP32 leverages, creation of ESP32 code, and the unfinished Android application. Research includes that into vesc open source software which handles the motor controller, identification of wheel to buy (restriction of clearance under board) and into Java development within Android studio. Physical design is the hours dedicated towards building the physical design (plexiglass box with cut holes for all the wires and attaching the motor with supports as to not rub the wheel on the board). Testing includes all testing during code development for ESP32, Android App, and motor controller in combination with the remote.
